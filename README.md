This is the repository for my personal website. I use vanilla JS for my scripts and Tailwind CSS for beautifing purposes.
the beautiful patterns in the background can be found on http://www.heropatterns.com/ and the fantastic design for my logo is by www.moritzmortimer.de.
If you find any bugs, please let me know!
